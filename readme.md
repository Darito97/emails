# Emails with nodemailer and Google

Hello!

This project is created as an example of a server that allows you to send emails with your Google account.

### How does it work?

This project uses the nodemailer library to create the connection.

### If I want to use it, what should I change?

Fork the project and specify the necessary environment variables in your .env file.

The necessary variables are:
- PORT: port where your server will run
- URL1: a url for cors
- URL2: a url for cors
- URL3: a url for cors
- URL4: a url for cors
- EMAIL_USER: your google email
- EMAIL_PASS: your google password

You need to configure your account to make the connection successful.
